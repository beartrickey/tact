Players decide moves for all characters per round

Client has frame scrubbing feature that allows players to navigate previous moves,
as well as make future moves

Moves get resolved at deadline

Players make moves. At deadline moves for each frame get resolved.
Some planned moves remain in tact, and some get replaced based on what actually happened that frame.

Frame is a single db entry that consists of a json object which holds all the events of that moment,
regardless of whether or not the frame has been resolved or not.
Both server and client know how to parse that json object.


What to do about two units that want to enter same space during a frame?
    -Stronger/faster unit takes the space?
    -Units grapple on space?
    -Neither can enter?

Futures investment of moves?
    -Players who lock in certain moves N frames in advance get some kind of bonus?

Client parses generic battle dictionary and makes relevant objects
    relevant objects persist in js memory
    relevant objects are flexible enough to hold data that changes from frame to frame (hp, row, col, etc)
    relevant objects:
        -characters
        -terrain map
        -items

Client stores frame data for each completed frame of the battle
Client stores frame data for each frame of planned moves by players
When a frame is scrubbed over, data from the frame object is parsed and shown visually

Client sends planned moves to server. Server validates the moves are plausible
Plausible moves are saved and then resolved with all other moves at the cycle deadline
